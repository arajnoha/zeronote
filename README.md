Ultra minimalist php flat-file notetaking app that is 845 bytes in a single file.

This is a no-database note taking application, that is very simple. It just lets you to write a note with name and lists them on the main page.
With the first note you write, the "n/" directory will be created and every note will be there in form of a text file. This gives you the ability
to perform actions on your notes with whatever utilities you like. It has exactly 857 bytes when 
compressed.

I'm working on a little more robust version now, in the scheme of the same philosophy, but with more fundamental features. Check in here later on to find out.
